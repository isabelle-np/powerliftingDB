# powerliftingDB
Utilizing an open source data set of powerlifters and their performance at federation-approved meets, I organized the data into a relational database using SQL Server.

I designed the database model with Sketch, a UI design tool.

##Data Licensing
Data was sourced from [OpenPowerlifting project](https://www.openpowerlifting.org), which you may download a copy from [Gitlab] (https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting/opl-data).
